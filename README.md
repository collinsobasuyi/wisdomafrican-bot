## ✅ 2. Custom Welcome Graphic

I'll generate a bold welcome graphic next — please confirm:
- Preferred **colors** (e.g., earthy tones, African print colors?)
- Should it say: “Welcome to WisdomAfricanBot” or something else?

Once you confirm, I’ll generate and drop it right in this chat.

---

## ✅ 3. Push to GitHub?

If you’d like help:
- Initializing the GitHub repo
- Uploading the full folder
- Setting up `.gitignore` and proper `.env` exclusion

Let me know if you're working locally or want a GitHub setup walkthrough.

### Let’s start with the graphic while you confirm the rest! What vibe should it give — calming, cultural, modern, or traditional?
